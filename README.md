This repository demonstrates common and less common errors encountered when using the Expo CLI for React Native development.  Solutions and debugging techniques are provided to resolve these issues.

**Common Error Scenarios:**

* **Dependency Conflicts:**  Conflicting versions of packages, especially between dependencies of different modules.
* **Incorrect Configuration:**  Problems in the `expo.json` or `package.json` files, such as missing or incorrect fields, or version mismatches.
* **Environment Issues:**  Problems related to Node.js version, npm/yarn versions, or operating system settings.
* **Build Process Errors:**  Issues arising during the build process, often triggered by native modules or platform-specific configurations.

**Debugging Tips:**

* **Check package.json and expo.json:**  Carefully examine these files for any errors, inconsistencies, or outdated dependencies.
* **Clean and reinstall dependencies:**  Try running `npm install --force` or `yarn install --force` to ensure correct package installations.
* **Check Node.js and npm/yarn versions:**  Make sure you're using compatible and up-to-date versions of Node.js, npm, and/or yarn.
* **Check console output carefully:**  Pay attention to detailed error messages and their stack traces.
* **Review Expo documentation:**  The official Expo documentation is a valuable resource for addressing common and uncommon problems.
