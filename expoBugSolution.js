The solution depends on the exact error encountered. Here are several approaches for common scenarios:

**1. Dependency Conflicts:**

* **Use a package manager's lock file:** Ensure your project uses either `package-lock.json` (npm) or `yarn.lock` for consistent dependency resolution across machines and environments.
* **Check `peerDependencies`:** Make sure that the versions of peer dependencies are compatible. Peer dependencies define what other libraries the current library requires to work properly.
* **Review package versions:**  Check that the versions of your packages are compatible. If there are conflicts, you may need to update or downgrade some packages.
* **`npm-check-updates` or `yarn upgrade-interactive`:**  Use these tools to identify and update outdated packages.

**2. Incorrect Configurations:**

* **Validate `expo.json`:** Verify that the values in `expo.json` are correct and aligned with your project setup. 
* **Validate `package.json`:** Ensure the dependencies are correctly specified and consistent. 
* **Clean and rebuild:**  Remove the `node_modules` folder and the `ios` and `android` folders (if they exist), then reinstall dependencies and rebuild your project.

**3. Environment Issues:**

* **Use a consistent environment:**  Ensure Node.js, npm, and Expo CLI versions match across machines where you develop.
* **Consider using a virtual machine:** Use a consistent environment by using a virtual machine.

**4. Build Process Errors:**

* **Check native modules:**  If you're using native modules, make sure they are correctly configured and compatible with your project setup.
* **Consult error messages carefully:**  Expo's build process provides valuable output; analyze error messages to identify the problem's root cause.

Remember to always consult Expo's official documentation for the latest best practices and troubleshooting tips.
