This error occurs when using Expo CLI to manage an Expo project.  The exact error message can vary, but it often involves issues related to package resolution, missing dependencies, or incorrect configurations within the project's `package.json` or `expo.json` files.  Here's an example of an error that might be seen in the console:

```
Error:  Could not resolve "some-package" from "path/to/node_modules"
```

This typically suggests that there's a problem with how npm or yarn is managing the project's dependencies.
